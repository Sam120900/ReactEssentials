<!-- as we get more createelement calls on our page it gets a lot more complicated
    every single element we want to create has to have its own createelemtent call
    so we need a helper or something like that to help us with this complexity
    this helper is called JSX -  JavaScript as XML -> it is a html like syntax for
    ...creating UI elements 
    now instead of using all the create element calls, we can use tags instead
    this is shown in the index.html file under the folder named "unordered_list_with_xml"
